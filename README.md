This homework challanged me to develop my problom solving skills and gooling skills. I found alot of code that would build diffrent styles of passwordgeneraters which helped me figure out how to structure the path. I felt like I lacked a solid understanding of JS and started to spend more time studying the basics ultimatly leading me to the idea that time and repitition will be needed to understand how and what to do with this language. this prodject came down to creating a randomized selcecter that would listen to inputs recived from a user.
